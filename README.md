# beachstory

_The story begins at the beach. The main character is an adult scholar from a large vessel, motivated by fame. He finds himself in a challenge involving the heavens._

It was a cold and stormy night. Carlos descended from his large boat with a pile of books. He hoped to sell his books on the beach and find fame.

However, little did he know, his books were so bad they enraged the gods. Lighting struck his vessel and he was stranded.

He heard a voice. "Write a better book and you can leave this island."

He was sad, annoyed. He couldn't understand why. His book was amazing!

Carlos was perplexed. He was sure he was the best author in the world. "Why would the gods be angered by perfection?"

He spied a woman sitting on the beach. Carlos thought that she looked like she could understand fine literature, much better than the gods could. He came up to her, and asked her to read his book.

After looking at his book for a few seconds, the woman looked up at Carlos. She seemed amused. Carlos cried "Why are you amused by my book, it's a work of art?!"

_more stuff. blah blah blah_
