_The story begins at the beach. The main character is an adult scholar from a large vessel, motivated by fame. He finds himself in a challenge involving the heavens._

It was a cold and stormy night. Carlos descended from his large boat with a pile of books. He hoped to sell his books on the beach and find fame. 

However, little did he know, his books were so bad they enraged the gods. Lighting struck his vessel and he was stranded. 

He heard a voice. "Write a better book and you can leave this island." 

He was sad, annoyed. He couldn't understand why. His book was amazing!

Carlos was perplexed. He was sure he was the best author in the world. "Why would the gods be angered by perfection?"

He tried many time, and at last, he found that the god really likes the book about ruby. He continued to write books about it until he died. Why he can not leave the island ? Because the god was once the best programmer in the world.
